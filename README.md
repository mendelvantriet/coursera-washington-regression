# coursera-washington-regression

I translated this example code from Graphlab to scikit-learn, as a learning excercise. The original Graphlab code was part of a Coursera course I took in 2016. I also did the excercises using scikit-learn instead of Graphlab. I believe that nowadays the teachers also provide a scikit-learn version of the example code and assignments, making this repository useless for other people. 

This repository does not contain any answers to excercises.
